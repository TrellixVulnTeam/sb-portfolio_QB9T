After the web app was set up, I called in the Rest API from The Movie Database to dynamically retrieve the content for each movie. I referenced the developer documentation and support for the information needed to set up and call in the data properly. Using the Rest API in conjunction with React.js made for simple and DRY code that created a dynamic web app.',

Although the design wasn't definite, I knew I wanted a dark feel to the web app, to emulate the feel of a theatre. I then created an interactive prototype of the web app using Adobe Illustrator. Eventually, I landed with the current design. I used the marquee style borders to imitate the marquee lights often seen on cinemas and bordering film posters.",

We set up the basics on the live website and then used the Migrate DB Pro wordpress plugin to merge any changes to the localhost website. The custom theme was built using the Underscores starter theme with Sass. Since we were working as a group, we used GitHub to collaborate and share changes to the custom theme with each other. One cool feature of this website is the locations page. Using the Leaflet maps plugin and JS, we created an interactive map that displays our locations and filters them.',

We decided that we wanted a warm and earthy feel for the websites so it could reflect the company's ideals of being family run and welcoming. The project's wireframes were built using Adobe XD and then were eventually turned into high fidelity mockups. We made sure to go through each component and page to figure out the proper PHP template before beginning development and styling. This project was styled using Sass and pushed to GitHub.",

One reason I specifically chose React is I knew it would be easy in the future to add or edit projects. The data is being called from the 'projects' object stored in the projects.js file. The homepage projects are being filtered using .filter() to find the projects with the tag “Featured Project.” That will make it easy, if in the future I wanted to swap out the projects on my home page for different ones. All in all, I love using React. The routing system is laid out in a way I really enjoy and it's able to do many things static websites can't do.",
